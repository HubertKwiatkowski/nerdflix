I'm pretty sure that this app can be done in faster and more efficient way, but I was using only tools, that I know - quite recentyl started do learn JS, still need a lot of practice. I tried to make it as best as I could with my set of known tools. And because of that, I didn't use any frameworks, just JS.

Just started on the responsivnes of the app - view is only optimall for 1440px wide.

I think that I would be able to finish an app like this, but it would require more than 8h (there are still things that I need to google regarding JS)
